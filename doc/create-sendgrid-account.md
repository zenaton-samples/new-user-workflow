# Create a Sendgrid API key

If you don't have a Sendgrid account, you can signup [here](https://signup.sendgrid.com/).

Then you can create an API key [here](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/api_keys), by clicking the "Create API key" button.

Type a name for the key for example `zenaton_sendgrid`.
Then click "Create & view".

Copy this API key for later, because it won't show again.
